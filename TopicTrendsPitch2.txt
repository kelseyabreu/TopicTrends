Everything I Should Know (Key Themes & Talking Points for Your Pitch)
Core Problem: You're solving the massive challenge of information overload and hidden patterns when collecting feedback/ideas from large groups. Emphasize the inefficiency and bias of traditional methods. (Pitch)
Your Unique Solution: AI-powered semantic grouping is the hero. It's not just keyword matching; it understands meaning to cluster similar ideas. This is your core differentiator. (Pitch, README, backend AI code)
Key Benefits: Inclusive participation, real-time insights, actionable data, efficiency, and evidence-based decision-making. (Pitch)
How It Works (Simplified for Pitch):
Leader creates a "Discussion" (focused topic/question).
Participants join via link/QR and submit ideas.
AI processes and groups these ideas in real-time.
Leaders see organized topics and can drill down. (Pitch, Roadmap - some parts ✅, some ❌ for full real-time UX)
Target Applications: Government (town halls, policy), Corporate (all-hands, strategy), Education (classroom, curriculum), Event Management (audience engagement). Be ready with examples for each. (Pitch)
Current State (Honest Assessment):
Strengths: Core user auth, discussion/idea creation, basic AI grouping is implemented. Sharing links/QR codes work. Terminology is now consistent ("Discussion," "Topic"). (Roadmap ✅)
Weaknesses/WIP: User experience needs work (charts, filters, responsiveness). Advanced user/discussion management is largely missing. Real-time updates for multiple simultaneous users need fixing. Full verification system is incomplete. Performance/testing and deployment readiness are major gaps. Significant technical debt around security and config. (Roadmap ❌, ⚠️)
The "Science" (Simplified): You use transformer models for semantic understanding (embeddings) and clustering algorithms to group. Adaptive thresholds (pitched) are a good concept to mention. (Pitch, README - currently Genkit/Ollama/Nomic/Gemma3)
Roadmap Vision:
Short-term: Cleanup (branding, errors, secure tokens, env vars).
Medium-term: Feature completion (likes were ✅, now filters, "My Discussions", basic charts, verification).
Longer-term (Implied by "Missing"): Full admin capabilities, advanced analytics, robust background tasks, performance scaling, mature deployment & operations, multiple verification methods, data retention.
Security & Privacy (Pitch vs. Reality):
Pitch: Data encryption, privacy options, compliance-ready.
Reality (Roadmap TD.1): Hardcoded credentials, localStorage tokens, missing CSRF/rate limiting. Be very careful how you present this. Focus on the intended security, and acknowledge that hardening is a top short-term priority.
Questions I Should Know (and Answers based on your files)
Here’s a categorized list of questions and how to answer them based only on your provided information.
I. Product & Value Proposition
Q: What problem does TopicTrends solve?
A: TopicTrends tackles the inefficiency and information overload leaders face when trying to gather meaningful input from large groups. Traditional methods are slow, often dominated by a few voices, and make it hard to see the real patterns in feedback. We turn scattered comments into clear, actionable insights. (Source: Pitch - "The Problem We Solve")
Q: How is TopicTrends different from existing survey tools or feedback platforms?
A: Our key differentiator is AI-powered semantic grouping. Unlike tools that rely on pre-defined categories or simple keyword matching, TopicTrends understands the meaning behind ideas. It can group submissions like "More benches by the lake" and "Additional seating near the water" together, even if they use different words. This uncovers hidden consensus and reduces manual sorting. (Source: Pitch - "Intelligent Semantic Grouping")
Q: Who is your target audience?
A: We're targeting leaders and organizers in Government (for town halls, public consultations), Corporate settings (all-hands meetings, strategic planning), Education (classroom engagement, curriculum feedback), and Event Management (audience Q&A, post-event feedback). Essentially, anyone needing to understand the collective intelligence of a large group. (Source: Pitch - "Applications Across Sectors")
Q: Can you give me a simple example of how it works?
A: Absolutely. Imagine a city council asking for park improvement ideas. Citizens submit hundreds of suggestions. Instead of manually reading each one, TopicTrends automatically groups them. So, "add more trash cans," "need more bins," and "better waste disposal" would all cluster into a "Waste Management" topic, instantly showing its importance. (Source: Pitch - concept, README - functionality overview)
Q: What are the main benefits for a user (e.g., a city manager or CEO)?
A: For leaders, the benefits are significant:
Efficiency: Saves hours, even days, of manual feedback analysis.
Inclusivity: Ensures all voices contribute to the insights, not just the loudest.
Clarity: Provides a clear, data-driven view of what truly matters to their audience.
Actionability: Transforms raw input into prioritized themes they can act upon.
Real-Time Understanding: (Pitched as ideal) They can see themes emerge as they happen, allowing for dynamic facilitation. Current state: Socket.IO for single user works, multi-user needs fix. (Source: Pitch, Roadmap)
II. Features & Functionality (Current State & Roadmap)
Q: What features are currently implemented and working?
A: The core is there: users can register, log in, and verify emails. They can create discussions, share them via links or QR codes, and submit ideas. We have an initial version of AI-powered grouping that organizes these ideas into topics, and users can view these topics and individual ideas. Basic user settings like profile updates are also functional. We recently completed a terminology refactor for consistency. (Source: Roadmap - "What's Already Implemented")
Q: You mention "real-time updates." How real-time is it currently?
A: We use Socket.IO for real-time updates. When a new idea is submitted by a user, their own UI updates to reflect this and basic grouping occurs. (Source: Roadmap - Implemented: "Real-time updates via Socket.IO"). However, we've identified that ensuring these updates reflect seamlessly for all other simultaneously connected users is a key item on our roadmap to fix. (Source: Roadmap - Missing: "Fix sockerIO events for multiple users")
Q: How does the AI grouping work? What technology are you using?
A: Each idea is converted into a semantic vector using embedding models – currently, we're using Nomic Embed Text via Ollama. Then, clustering algorithms group these ideas based on semantic similarity. We use Gemma3, also via Ollama, for suggesting topic names based on these clusters. (Source: README - "Technology Stack", "AI-powered Grouping Algorithm"; Backend code - genkit/cluster.py, genkit/idea.py, genkit/flows/topic_names.py)
(For a more technical audience): We are currently using Genkit with local Ollama instances for embedding (nomic-embed-text) and topic naming (gemma3). The clustering itself is done via algorithms that process these embeddings.
Q: Can users submit ideas anonymously? Is identity verification possible?
A: Yes, the platform is designed for both.
Anonymous: The pitch highlights an "Anonymous Submission Option" to encourage honest feedback. Our backend has logic for "participation tokens" (X-Participation-Token header in ideas.py, auth.py service) to support this for users who aren't logged in.
Verification: The pitch mentions "Verification Capability." The roadmap indicates a "Verification System" is partially implemented on the UI side, but the backend needs work. We plan to support multiple verification methods like ID/passport eventually. (Source: Pitch, Roadmap - Section 7, Backend code for tokens)
Q: What about managing discussions? Can I see discussions I've created or joined?
A: Currently, users can create discussions and join them via links. Viewing all discussions is possible. However, dedicated views for "My Discussions" (created by the user) and "Joined Discussions" (participated in) are on our roadmap and not yet implemented. (Source: Roadmap - Discussion Management ❌)
Q: Are there any analytics or charts available now?
A: The ability to view topics and individual ideas gives a basic level of insight. We just implemented an MVP backend endpoint for topic idea counts suitable for charts (analytics.py). Fully-fledged charts and visualizations, as well as more advanced discussion analytics (views, likes on topics, etc.), are planned but not yet implemented in the UI. (Source: Roadmap - UX.1 ❌, DM.3 ❌; Backend MVP Feature 1 we just discussed).
Q: Can discussions be made private? How is access controlled?
A: We just implemented the backend foundation for public vs. private discussion settings in our MVP. Users can now set a discussion as private upon creation. Access to private discussions is restricted to the creator and, with our recent RBAC groundwork, will be extendable to admins or specific users/roles. Full discussion ownership and more granular access control are on the roadmap. (Source: Roadmap - DM.3 ❌, UM.2 ❌; Backend MVP Feature 5).
Q: What about user management features like deleting users or assigning roles?
A: Basic user authentication, registration, and profile updates are in place. Password reset is also functional. We just implemented an MVP admin feature to anonymize users. Full user deletion with all associated data, and a comprehensive user roles and permissions system, are important features on our roadmap. (Source: Roadmap - UM.2 ❌; Backend MVP Feature 3 & 4).
Q: Are there filters for ideas (e.g., by category, keyword)?
A: The backend query_service.py and QueryParameters model are designed to support advanced filtering by various fields, including keywords (via search or filter.keywords.in) and date ranges. This backend capability is robust. Integrating this into a user-friendly filtering UI on the frontend is a planned User Experience improvement. (Source: Roadmap - UX.1 ❌; Backend code for query_service and query_models).
III. Technical Details & Feasibility
Q: What's your technology stack?
A: Our frontend is React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The backend is FastAPI (Python) with MongoDB as the database. For AI, we're currently using Genkit with local Ollama models (Nomic Embed Text for embeddings, Gemma3 for topic naming). Real-time communication is handled by Socket.IO. We use Vercel for backend deployment, Netlify for frontend, and MongoDB Atlas for the database in production. (Source: README - "Technology Stack")
Q: You mentioned local Ollama models. How does that impact performance and scalability?
A: Using local Ollama models provides flexibility for development and customization. For the current single-instance backend, CPU-intensive AI tasks running in the same process as the API can be a bottleneck.
(Your answer MUST then pivot to the plan, as this is a major concern)
Our roadmap includes performance testing for grouping with large datasets and optimizing real-time updates for scale. As we move towards production, we'll evaluate the best approach for deploying and scaling the AI components, which might involve dedicated AI processing services, optimizing model usage, or exploring cloud-based AI alternatives to ensure the API remains responsive. The current worker.py (using Redis as a queue for process_idea) is a first step towards decoupling AI processing. (Source: README, Roadmap P&T, Backend code - worker.py)
Q: How do you handle background tasks like AI processing or clustering?
A: When an idea is submitted, AI processing tasks like formatting and embedding are queued using Redis and processed by an in-process worker (worker.py). For discussion-wide clustering, we currently use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks for manual triggers, but a more robust background task system for clustering is on our roadmap. (Source: Backend code - ideas.py adding to Redis queue, worker.py processing; discussions.py using BackgroundTasks; Roadmap - Queues/Background tasks ❌ for clustering specifically)
Q: What are your plans for testing and ensuring quality?
A: Currently, end-to-end and integration tests are not yet implemented, which is a recognized gap. Our roadmap includes setting up automated testing, conducting load testing for connections and grouping, and performance testing with large datasets. (Source: Roadmap - P&T.8 ❌)
Q: What about security? You mentioned some concerns in your roadmap.
A: Security is a top priority. We've identified several areas for immediate improvement in our short-term roadmap, including addressing hardcoded credentials, moving from localStorage to HttpOnly cookies for tokens (which we just discussed implementing the backend for), and implementing CSRF protection and API rate limiting (also discussed for MVP). The pitch outlines our goal for enterprise-grade security with data encryption and robust access management. (Source: Roadmap - TD.1, RNS.1; Pitch - "Security & Privacy")
IV. Future & Vision
Q: What are the next key features you plan to implement?
A: Our immediate focus, beyond stabilization and security hardening, is on completing core user experience features. This includes adding more advanced idea filtering in the UI, creating "My Discussions" and "Joined Discussions" views, developing basic charts and visualizations for data insights, and completing the backend for our verification system. (Source: Roadmap - "Medium-term (Feature Completion)")
Q: How do you plan to make money? What's your pricing model?
A: The pitch mentions a "Cloud-Based SaaS" deployment option, which suggests a subscription model. However, a detailed pricing model and plans are listed as "Not Implemented" and are part of our "Business & Deployment" recommendations to develop, likely after further load testing and cost calculation. (Source: Pitch - "Deployment Options"; Roadmap - Deployment & Operations ❌, RNS.4 🔼)
Q: The pitch mentions "Adaptive Threshold Optimization" for clustering. Is that implemented?
A: The pitch describes this as part of our core technology vision. Currently, our clustering (cluster.py, centroid_clustering.py) uses predefined distance thresholds (small, medium, large in config.py) that are selected based on idea count. A fully self-adapting system that dynamically optimizes thresholds based on data characteristics without manual tiers is a more advanced implementation we'd work towards as the AI matures.
Q: What about multilingual support?
A: The pitch mentions "Multilingual Support: Automatic translation capabilities (future enhancement)." This is a planned future feature and not currently implemented. (Source: Pitch)
Q: How will you ensure the AI grouping remains accurate and unbiased?
A: This is a critical aspect. Our initial approach uses established embedding models. As we gather more data and user feedback, we plan to continuously evaluate the quality of the groupings. Future enhancements could involve allowing users to refine topics, merge or split them, or provide feedback on grouping quality, which can then be used to fine-tune the models or parameters. Clear documentation on how clustering works (Roadmap - User Onboarding ❌) is also important for transparency.
Q: How will you handle potentially very large discussions (e.g., 10,000+ ideas)?
A: The pitch states, "Whether collecting ideas from 10 participants or 10,000, TopicTrends maintains performance and accuracy." This is our goal. The current implementation uses a worker for idea processing and has basic clustering. Our roadmap explicitly includes "Performance testing for grouping with large datasets" and "Optimize real-time updates for scale." Achieving this will involve optimizing algorithms, potentially moving to more scalable AI infrastructure, and robust background task management.
