              TopicTrends began with a simple observation: in meetings, town halls, and forums worldwide, 
              the same pattern repeatsâ€”a few people dominate the conversation while valuable insights from 
              others remain unheard and connections between ideas go unnoticed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in 2024, our team of data scientists, UX designers, and community organizers came 
              together to solve this problem, creating a platform that gives every voice equal weight 
              and reveals the true patterns in group thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to transform how organizations understand collective input, making it 
              possible to derive meaningful, actionable insights from hundreds or thousands of contributions.

            <AccordionTrigger>What makes TopicTrends different from surveys or polls?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Unlike traditional surveys with predefined answers, TopicTrends lets participants express ideas in their own words. 
              Our AI then finds patterns across these open-ended responses, revealing insights that structured surveys would miss. 
              This approach captures nuance, discovers unexpected connections, and gives everyone an equal voice.

          <AccordionItem value="item-2">
            <AccordionTrigger>Is TopicTrends only for large groups?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              No! While TopicTrends excels with large groups, it's valuable for any size. Even with smaller teams, 
              the automatic organization saves time and reveals connections you might not notice manually. 
              Our algorithm adapts to group size, providing meaningful insights whether you have 10 or 10,000 participants.

          <AccordionItem value="item-3">
            <AccordionTrigger>How does the AI grouping work?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Our algorithm converts each idea into a mathematical representation called an embedding, then compares the similarity 
              between ideas. Those above a certain threshold are grouped together, with thresholds dynamically adjusted based on group size. 
              Unlike simple keyword matching, our semantic approach understands meaning, identifying similar concepts even when 
              expressed with entirely different terminology.

          <AccordionItem value="item-4">
            <AccordionTrigger>What's the difference between anonymous and verified participation?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Verified participation requires logging in and shows your username with your ideas. This builds accountability and trust, 
              particularly in professional settings. Anonymous participation doesn't require an account and shows your ideas without 
              identifying information, encouraging candid feedback on sensitive topics. Discussion creators can choose which mode best 
              fits their goals and context.

            <AccordionTrigger>Can I export the results?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Yes, discussion creators can export results in CSV or PDF format, including all ideas, their groupings, and engagement metrics. 
              This makes it easy to incorporate insights into reports, presentations, or further analysis. The exports maintain the 
              hierarchical structure identified by our AI, preserving the relationships between ideas and topics.
